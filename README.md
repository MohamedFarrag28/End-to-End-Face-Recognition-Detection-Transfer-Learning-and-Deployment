# **End-to-End Face Recognition and Detection with Transfer Learning & ONNX Deployment**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements an end-to-end face recognition and detection system using deep learning. It leverages OpenCV for face detection, InceptionV3 for feature extraction, and ONNX for efficient inference. The system is deployed using Streamlit and hosted via Ngrok.  

## **Features**  
âœ… Face detection using OpenCVâ€™s DNN module  
âœ… Face recognition with InceptionV3 and transfer learning  
âœ… ONNX, TFLite, and Keras support for flexible model deployment   
âœ… Cosine similarity-based recognition with two modes:
 * Full embedding (more precise but requires more memory)
 * Average embedding (faster, suitable for general cases)
   
âœ… Real-time recognition via webcam and image uploads  
âœ… Streamlit-based interactive web app  
âœ… Hosted using Ngrok for easy remote access  

## **Installation**  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedFarrag28/End-to-End-Face-Recognition-Detection-Transfer-Learning-and-Deployment.git
   cd End-to-End-Face-Recognition-Detection-Transfer-Learning-ONNX-Deployment
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Streamlit app:**  
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## **Usage**  
- Upload an image or use a webcam for live face detection and recognition(for now -- > capturing single images).  
- Adjust similarity thresholds for better recognition.  
- View detected faces with predicted names.

## **Example of Face Recognition Output**

### Similarity Based Test Example:
Here is an example of what the system looks like with similarity-based recognition:

![Similarity Based Test](output_samples/Similarity_based_test_2.png)

This image shows how the system works with different similarity thresholds and how faces are recognized.

### Check Unknown Faces Example:
Another example showing the system detecting unknown faces:

![Check Unknown Faces](output_samples/Check_Unknown.png)

This image illustrates the detection of unknown faces and how they are processed.
